Salary Calculator

## Description
Duration: 2 days

The goal was to create a table that took a set of inputs that would then be displayed within the table. The table will have a total of a set of inputs displayed underneath the table.

To take the inputs, a set of input fields we created to accept the input of information. Adding a submit button pushed the information into the table. A delete button was also created to allow the user to remove incorrect information from the table. At underneath the table a total is displayed; in the default settings the salary is totaledl, the total has predetermined limit set to which if the limit is exceeded would highlight red.
